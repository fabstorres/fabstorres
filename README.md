**🎉 Happy New Year!**

My most recent project, **Fabs Chat** (Multi-Modal Chatbot), has moved to  
[fabs-chat.vercel.app](https://fabs-chat.vercel.app).

The site is temporarily down during the holidays while we migrate to Vercel for
hosting and infrastructure.

Side note: Attachment support is currently disabled, resumable streams are
currently disabled, and only Gemini models are currently open for use.

**Here’s a preview:**
